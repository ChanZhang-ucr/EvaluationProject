# EvaluationGame

Developed with Unreal Engine 4

Starting level: EvaluationStart(Evaluation_Start in widget name)

1. Click "Start" botton to the next level.
2. "WSAD" to move, "Space" to jump
3. When close to wall: "W" to climb up. You may jump then climb
4. Run over the finish line to endgame.
5. You may start again with the "Again" botton.
6. If you want some challenge, you may run level EvaluationMainReverseJump.

(If the project ask you for ArrowActor Class, you may simply ignore it since it was has no effect for the current project. I was originally seeking to design an actor to detect collision with arrow then I found out that I don't need it for a simply wall climbing mechanics.) 

(UE does not automatically help me push the changes in cpp files, so I just downloaded github desktop to help me with it.)
